# Practical 10
## Reflection

### 1. Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject? What did you learn from doing the estimates?
#### Over the course, my ability to estimate task durations improved as I learned more about the factors affecting task complexity. This helped in better planning and management of my time.
### 2. Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
#### Participating in code reviews taught me the importance of clear, maintainable code and offered new perspectives and techniques from peers, enhancing my coding skills.
### 3. Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
#### If I were in charge, I'd incorporate more collaborative elements into the practical tasks to mirror real-world coding environments and encourage peer learning.

## Code Review
### Prac 06
#### Prac 6 code review request by Xirui-Huang 路 Pull Request #2 路 Xirui-Huang/CP1404-Practicals (github.com)
#### When I conducted a practical review in 2006, I found some deficiencies in my work, but the changes had been completed before git was pushed, and then I asked my classmates to conduct a commit auxiliary review, which also indicated that there was no problem. This practical results in good results. Then, through the teacher's comments, it was found that there were still two small problems that were not found, which indicated that it still needed to be carefully examined.

### Prac 08
#### Prac 8 code review request by Xirui-Huang 路 Pull Request #4 路 Xirui-Huang/CP1404-Practicals (github.com)
#### When I conducted the practical review in 2008, I found that my work was basically perfect, and then I asked my classmates to commit the auxiliary review, and they also said that there was no problem. This practical results in good results.
